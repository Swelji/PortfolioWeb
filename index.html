            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            <p>Hello! My name is Arabella Jarapa, a proud 20-year-old who is passionate about growth, creativity, and embracing every opportunity that life presents. I hail from the serene town of Basud in Camarines Norte, where I grew up surrounded by the beauty of nature on our family farm. Currently, I am a second-year BSIT student at Camarines Norte State College, driven by an unrelenting desire to grow both personally and professionally. My ultimate goal is to give my mother the life she truly deserves, fulfilling a promise of happiness and comfort.</p>
            <p>My interests are a blend of creativity and self-expression, including music, arts, dancing, and singing. I’ve always been captivated by the power of art to communicate emotions and tell stories. With a creative mind and a love for arts and crafts, I enjoy turning ideas into reality—whether through designing, programming, or crafting. My technical skills extend to creating and programming apps, websites, and systems, which have not only honed my problem-solving abilities but also fueled my ambition to become a skilled IT professional.</p>
            <p>Music plays a significant role in my life as well. I have been a part of several marching bands, where I learned to play the trumpet, mellophone, and saxophone. Each note and rhythm has taught me discipline, teamwork, and the beauty of harmonizing with others—a lesson that resonates with every aspect of my journey. Beyond music, I also find inspiration in anime and movies, which spark my imagination and deepen my appreciation for storytelling and culture.</p>
            <p>In addition to my artistic pursuits, I’m proud to have developed a confident personality. I can face a crowd with ease, even though I humbly admit I’m still learning to master the art of public speaking. As ITS Sentinel I, I have embraced leadership and responsibility, which have challenged me to continuously improve and inspire those around me.</p>
            <p>I firmly believe in the quote by Franklin D. Roosevelt: “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” This mantra motivates me to take risks and embrace new challenges, even when they push me out of my comfort zone. I understand that adapting to this ever-changing world requires an open mind and the courage to learn, even if it means reevaluating long-held principles.</p>
            <p>In everything I do, my aspiration to create a meaningful impact shines through. Whether it’s through innovative projects, artistic endeavors, or uplifting the people around me, I aim to leave a positive mark. My journey is one of continuous growth, driven by a heart full of dreams and a deep sense of purpose.</p>
